; zcatc.nasm: tiny stdin-to-stdout decompression filter implementation of the gzip, zlib and Deflate file formats for DOS 8086 in NASM assembly
; by pts@fazekas.hu at Fri Sep 26 00:32:20 CEST 2025
;
; Usage: zcatc <file.gz >file
;
; Compile, for decompressing gzip and raw Deflate: nasm-0.98.39 -O0 -w+orphan-labels -f bin -o zcatc.com zcatc.nasm
; Compile, for decompressing gzip and zlib: nasm-0.98.39 -O0 -w+orphan-labels -DUSE_ZLIB -f bin -o zlcatc.com zcatc.nasm
; This program compiles identically with optimized (-O32700) and unoptimized (-0) NASM.
;
; Program size: The DOS 8086 .com program zcatc.com is 958 bytes. It's
; written in manually optimized 8086 assembly in the NASM syntax. The
; feature-equivalent C program, zcats.c can be compiled to DOS 8086 .com
; program of 1624 byes with OpenWatcom C compiler and a custom tiny libc.
; The reasons why the assembly implementation is >40% smaller are the heavy
; manual optimizations.
;
; Minimum DOS version needed: MS-DOS >=2.00, IBM PC DOS >=2.00 or a DOS
; emulator (such as DOSBox, emu2, kvikdos, NTVDM). There is no file size
; limit, the program works as long as DOS or the emulator can supply the
; compressed input and consume the uncompressed output.
;
; Memory requirements: <=0x9180 bytes, including 0x80 bytes of extra stack
; space for DOS and interrupt handlers. Of these bytes, the majority, 0x8000
; bytes are used by the ring buffer (dictionary), as mandated by the
; [Deflate specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt).
; Actually, DOS will typically use 0x10000 bytes (64 KiB) plus a few dozen
; bytes for process overhead to run this DOS .com program.
;
; This program does the same as the zcat(1) program in gzip, except for these:
;
; * This program ignores its command-line arguments.
; * The error conditions are the same, but the error messages are different.
; * The set of supported input file formats are different (but both
;   programs support the gzip file format).
; * The set of gzip flags supported is different.
; * This program doesn't compute or check the CRC-32 and Adler-32 checksums
;   of the uncompressed output data.
; * This program doesn't flush the write buffer on error.
; * This program stops at the end of the first Deflate stream.
;
; This program does the same as
; https://github.com/pts/pts-zcat/blob/master/muzcat.c , except for the
; following functionality differences:
;
; * This program has stricter error checking and thus memory-safe operation.
; * The set of supported input file formats are different (but both
;   programs support the gzip file format).
; * The set of gzip flags supported is different.
; * This program stops reading its input after the end of the first Deflate
;   stream.
; * This program uses a bit less memory.
; * This program stops at the end of the first Deflate stream.
;
; NASM configuration options at compile time:
;
; * `-DUSE_DEFLATE` (default): As input, support the
;   [gzip](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt) and [raw
;   Deflate](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt) file format rather
;   than the *.lzw file format.
; * `-DUSE_ZLIB`: As input, support the
;   [gzip](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt) and
;   [zlib](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt) file formats rather
;   than the *.lzw file format.
; * `-DUSE_NZTREELEAF`: Use a non-zero `TREE_LEAF` value; this helps
;   debugging of the Huffman tree builder.
; * `-DUSE_SCRAMBLECODE`: Use code to compute the bit count RLE code
;   scrambling order rather than a lookup table; this makes the program file
;   10 bytes longer.
; * `-DUSE_DEBUG`: Print lots of debug info to stdout, don't write
;   uncompressed data.
;
; Things to do before a release (all done):
;
; * Run a smoke test with small input files with and without -DUSE_ZLIB.
; * Compile with -O999999999 and check that they are bitwise identical. Also compile with newer NASM.
; * Run the big test with >42000 .gz files for both zcatc.nasm and zcats.c.
;
; TODO(pts): Add support for multiple gzip streams (such as in Alpine Linux APKINDEX.*.tar.gz); both gzip and muzcat support multiple streams; for that we need EOF detection.
;
; !! Calculate (1 << i) - 1 using a lookup table (lut_pow2_mask) in read_bits_max_8 (4-byte instruction with the right registers). Is it shorter? Probably not.

; corresponding edge in the tree (either to child 0 or 1). Stop decoding
; when you reach a leaf node, and the result is the value in that leaf node.
; In Huffman trees for Deflate, the root node is never a leaf node, thus
; each Huffman code is at least 1 bit long.
;
; Each tree is identified by a pointer to its root node within the array.
; Each node occupies two slots (of word == unsigned short): node_ptr[0] and
; node_ptr[1]. If node_ptr[0] == LEAF_PTR, then this is a leaf node, and the
; value is in node_ptr[1], with special invalid value BAD_LEAF_VALUE
; indicating an invalid Huffman code. Otherwise, this is a non-leaf node
; with two children: node_ptr[0] is a pointer to child 0, and node_ptr[1] is
; a pointer to child 1.
